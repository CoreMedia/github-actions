# GitHub Actions

Contains reusable workflows and actions for CoreMedia GitHub workflows.

We'll start with reusable workflows and might change (some of) them to actions later on.

Reusable workflows should be placed `.github/workflows` folder. This seems to be a good practice and
avoids potential name clashes with (replacing) actions.
