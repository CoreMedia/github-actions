# For most projects, this workflow file will not need changing; you simply need
# to commit it to your repository.
#
# You may wish to alter this file to override the set of languages analyzed,
# or to provide custom queries or build logic.
#
# ******** NOTE ********
# We have attempted to detect the languages in your repository. Please check
# the `language` matrix defined below to confirm you have the correct set of
# supported CodeQL languages.
#

# When the language to be analyzed is 'java', this workflow executes a Maven build prior to the analysis. But it
# assumes that all required artifacts that are needed for the build are already cached and no downloads from a
# custom Maven repository manager are required anymore.

# Required permissions that must be set in caller workflows (in private repositories):
# actions:          read      for github/codeql-action/* (reason not documented)
# contents:         read      for actions/checkout to fetch code
# security-events:  write     for github/codeql-action/upload-sarif to upload SARIF results
